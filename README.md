# tcf_tamid_BeyondCoffee
We will be designing and implementing BeyondCoffee, an app with the purpose of reimagining traditional "coffee chats" by matching users based on their goals and preferences. BeyondCoffee allows users to input short introductions, their interests, and potential takeaways from the chats. Users are also able to sync their calendars to automatically schedule the chats according to their availability. BeyondCoffee utilizes AI and algorithms to evaluate user preferences and match them respectively, establishing a time and date to meet and a proposed activity for both members. Users will have their own profiles, with passwords to authenticate them, and will be able to connect and interact (request to follow, dm, etc.) with other users of the app.

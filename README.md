# tcf_tamid_taMeet
We will be designing and implementing TaMeet, an app with the purpose of reimagining traditional Coffee Chats by matching users based on their goals and preferences. TaMeet allows users to input short introductions, their interests, potential takeaways from the chats, and ideas for the activities. Users are also allowed to sync their calendars to automatically schedule the chats according to their availability. TaMeet utilizes AI and an algorithm to evaluate user preferences and match them, establishing a time and date to meet and a proposed activity. Users will have their own profiles, with passwords to authenticate them, and will be able to connect and interact (request to follow, dm, etc.) with other users of the app.
